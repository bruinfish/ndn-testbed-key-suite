'pem' takes a CCNx keystore as input, and outputs X509 certificate
file which will be the input for 'mkey' (used by site operators)

For example, the following command
./pem -i /path/to/keystore -o /path/to/certificate.pem
reads from CCNx keystore locates in /path/to/keystore, and outputs
the X509 certificate as /path/to/certificate.pem.

If you are reading from the default keystore for you account,
which locates in $HOME/.ccnx/.ccnx_keystore, this should do it:
./pem -o my-name.pem
